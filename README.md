This is the work I've done for the assignment. I have added the required things in order to meet all three of the must have requirements as well as one of the should have requirements. I had 10 slots for the potions, or squares in this case to instantiate into. These squares can be moved around the slots by dragging and dropping. If a square is dropped into an already occupied slot, they will also swap places between one another. Each of the squares also have a random color assigned to them, as well as a counter to keep track of how many squares of the same color has been spawned over the course of the app. If all of the slots are filled, the generator will instead of adding squares with new colors, it will generate one of an already existing one until another slot is free by dragging a square outside of them. There's also a timer that will prevent the user from generating for 20 seconds. I have done the serialization part as well, where if you close the app, it will save the data onto a JSON file and will load of that file to retrieve the data to pick up where it left off. The variables that are saved are whether or not the slots are occupied, the color of the square that's occupying them, their counts, as well as the timer.
